# Project: Mandelzoom
A Mandelbrot set viewer.

### Features:
- Uses rubber band to zoom into a particular region.
- Dynamically resizes the window's aspect ratio.
- Undo/redo previous zooms.

### TODO:
- Linearize distribution of intensity (I), defined as the ratio between the number of trials before the sequence diverge and the cap.
- Better mapping from I to RGB triples ([0,1] -> [0.1]^3).
  - Currently using sine with period of `1 + alpha`, where `alpha` is a paramter.
  - Design some animation to traverse different combinations of RGB triples, possibly via the inverse Cantor pairing function generalized to Z^3.
  - More degrees of freedom, e.g. a larger zoo of non-linear functions and ways of combining them.
- Automatic zooming into a selected point.
  - Would need better precision (infinite precision?) floating point arithmetic.
- Optimized sequence computation and other ways to speed things up.
- Fully fix reshaping -- only render what is absolutely need to be re-rendered.
- Fix redo/undo to support further zooming-in/out even when the stack of operations is empty.
